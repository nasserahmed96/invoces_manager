# invoces_manager
A PyQt desktop app that manages invoices and proposals for the organization, most of the operations are generalized and can be used with different backend

The app allows you to create products categroies and brands alongside with invoices, it's currently under development as I make it for other backends (Restful APIs, Google sheets, other databases etc..) and not just SQLite, so every thing is well designed and implemented as best as I could to not affect performance in the future, you can find testing scripts in src/DataAccessObjectsTesting and testing files in Testing_Data, I use Pandas for data manipulation to not restrict my self with Qt SQLTableModel, also Pandas will be useful for the Dashboard and Data analysis staff.
